\begin_layout Title
NR 575 Instructions for Final Project 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important that you demonstrate that you have learned enough to apply
 your new knowledge of Bayesian modeling to your own research.
 This project will allow you to do so.
 It represents in nice coda (no pun intended) for the course.
 Your write up is due at the end of finals week, but I am happy to receive
 them sooner.
 Put them in the FinalProjects folder in the class dropbox.
 This is not a group project.
 Everyone in the class should turn one in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please structure your write-up in the following sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write a brief introduction to the problem you are studying.
 The first few sentences should provide the broad context –why is the general
 topic broadly important to the discipline of ecology, citing a 
\emph on
few
\emph default
 key papers.
 Proceed to explain why your specific work will advance understanding of
 the broad topic.
 Describe the core questions and or objectives of the work.
 The introduction should resemble a funnel – big topics at the top narrowing
 to specific questions at the bottom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data and Research design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Describe the data that you will use to fit models and how they were collected.
 Imagine that you were giving me one of the word problems on writing hierarchica
l models I gave you (payback).
 I need to know enough to be able to write the model myself.
 I don't need to know details of methods for data collection, but I do need
 to understand the design.
 Explain spatial and or temporal structure of the data and describe sources
 of calibration and sampling uncertainty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write and explain the deterministic model (or models if you plan model selection
) that expresses your ideas about way a process works.
 Most of these are likely to be from the general linear model family.
 Others may be more specialized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write the proportionality between the posterior and joint distributions.
 I urge you to strive for a model that is hierarchical in some fashion because
 this has been the emphasis of the course.
 You may include a Bayesian network as part of the description if you like,
 but I want to see that diagram translated into fully specified math, including
 your choices of distributions for likelihoods, latent quantities, and priors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will not insist that you deal with spatial autocorrelation if your data
 are spatially structured because we will not cover this material until
 the end of the course.
 That said, I will be impressed and forgiving if you take this on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write a section that describes the computational procedures you will use,
 tests for convergence, and posterior predictive checks.
 Describe any important derived quantities.
 This should read the section you would write for a paper to be submitted
 to a journal.
 Consult published Bayesian papers for examples.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Length: No more than four pages, excluding a few literature citations.
 I expect that three pages will usually suffice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Document: You may prepare this document in R Markdown, LyX or LaTeX compiled
 to a .pdf file.
 Word documents will not be accepted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Math: All mathematics must be properly formatted using LaTeX.
 Pay close attention to the instructions for notation in the R Markdown
 handout I gave early in the course.
 Posterior and joint distributions will need to be written in the LaTeX
 equation array or align environment as illustrated in that handout.
 The math should look crisp and sharp.

\begin_layout Description
Writing: Here are a few tips on grammar, usage, and clarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every paragraph must announce its purpose with a topic sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Minimize use of leading, dependent clauses.
 No more than three in the entire document, please.
 Simple declarative sentences are best until you can write like John McPhee.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Usage and grammar
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Although instead of while
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because instead of since
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
That for defining clauses; which for describing clauses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Never, ever, ever use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

respectively.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fewer to compare things counted; less for continuous variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Data is the plural of datum.
 The data are; never the data is.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Avoid use of multi-word nouns, e.g., use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

procedures for managing invasive plants
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in favor of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invasive plant management procedures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Avoid unfamiliar acronyms.
 They are a false economy.
 Better to use more words than to irritate the reader with mysterious, forgettab
le abbreviations.
